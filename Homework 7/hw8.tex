%%%%% PROBLEMS %%%%%

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Problem \arabic*.}]
\item Conisder the following problem which was discussed in class: \\
Suppose that we have a patient who was just tested for a particular disease and the test came out positive. We know that one in every thousand people has this disease. We also know that the test is not reliable: it has a false positive rate of 2\% and a false negative rate of 5\%. Our goal is then to assess our belief in the patient having the disease given that the test came out positive. If we let the propositional variable D stand for the patient has the disease, and the propositional variable T stand for the test came out positive, our goal is then to compute $Pr(D|T)$.
