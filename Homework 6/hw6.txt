1. For each pair of atomic sentences, give the most general unifier if it exists:
	(a) P(A,B,B), P(x,y,z) = {x/A, y/B, z/B}
	(b) Q(y, G(A,B)), Q(G(x,x),y) = cannot unify
	(c) R(x,A,z), R(B,y,z) = {x/B, y/A}
	(d) Older(Father(y),y), Older(Father(x),John) = {y/John, x/John}
	(e) Knows(Father(y),y), Knows(x,x) = cannot unify

2. Consider the following sentences:
	i. John likes all kinds of food.
	ii. Apples are food.
	iii. Chicken is food.
	iv. Anything anyone eats and isn't killed by is food.
	v. If you are killed by something, you are not alive.
	vi. Bill eats peanuts and is still alive. *
	vii. Sue eats everything Bill eats.

	(a) Translate these sentences into formulas in first-order logic.
		i. (A x)(Food(x) => Likes(John,x))
		ii. Food(Apples)
		iii. Food(Chicken)
		iv. (A x,y)(Eats(x,y) & ~Kills(y,x) => Food(y))
		v. (A x,y)(Kills(y,x) => ~Alive(x))
		vi. Eats(Bill,Peanuts) & Alive(Bill)
		vii. (A x)(Eats(Bill,x) => Eats(Sue,x))

	(b) Convert the fomrulas of part (a) into CNF.

		Simplify all =>
		i. (A x)(~Food(x) | Likes(John,x))
		iv. (A x,y)(~Eats(x,y) | Kills(y,x) | Food(y))
		v. (A x,y)(~Kills(y,x) | ~Alive(x))
		vii. (A x)(~Eats(Bill,x) | Eats(Sue,x))

		Standardize variables
		i. (A a)(~Food(a) | Likes(John,a))
		iv. (A b,c)(~Eats(b,c) | Kills(c,b) | Food(c))
		v. (A d,e)(~Kills(e,d) | ~Alive(d))
		vii. (A f)(~Eats(Bill,f) | Eats(Sue,f))

		Eliminate quantifiers
		i. ~Food(a) | Likes(John,a)
		iv. ~Eats(b,c) | Kills(c,b) | Food(c)
		v. ~Kills(e,d) | ~Alive(d)
		vii. ~Eats(Bill,f) | Eats(Sue,f)

	(c) Prove that John likes peanuts using resolution.
		
		i. ~Food(a) | Likes(John,a)
		ii. Food(Apples)
		iii. Food(Chicken)
		iv. ~Eats(b,c) | Kills(c,b) | Food(c)
		v. ~Kills(e,d) | ~Alive(d)
		vi. Eats(Bill,Peanuts)
		vii. Alive(Bill)
		viii. ~Eats(Bill,f) | Eats(Sue,f)

		Assume John does not like peanuts:
		ix. ~Likes(John, Peanuts)
		x. Resolve i and ix: ~Food(Peanuts)
		xi. Resolve v and vii: ~Kills(e,Bill)
		xii. Resolve iv and xi: ~Eats(Bill,c) | Food(c)
		xiii. Resolve vi and xii: Food(Peanuts) 

		There is a contradiction between x and xiii, therefore John likes peanuts.

	(d) Use resolution to answer the question, "What food does Sue eat?"

		Use i to vii from above.
		Assume Sue does not eat peanuts.
		ix. ~Eats(Sue,Peanuts)
		x. Resolve vi and viii: Eats(Sue,Peanuts)

		There is a contradiction between ix and x, therefore Sue eats peanuts.

	(e) Use resolution to answer (d) if, instead of the axiom marked with an asterisk above, we had:
	• If you don't eat, you die
	• If you die, you are not alive.
	• Bill is alive.

		New knowledge base:
		i. ~Food(a) | Likes(John,a)
		ii. Food(Apples)
		iii. Food(Chicken)
		iv. ~Eats(b,c) | Kills(c,b) | Food(c)
		v. ~Kills(e,d) | ~Alive(d)
		vi. Eats(g,h) | Dies(g)
		vii. ~Dies(i) | ~Alive(i)
		viii. Alive(Bill)
		ix. ~Eats(Bill,f) | Eats(Sue,f)

		Assume Sue does not eat apples:
		x. ~Eats(Sue,Apples)
		xi. Resolve vi and x: Dies(Sue)
		xii. Resolve vii and xi: ~Alive(Sue)
		xiii. Resolve v and viii: ~Kills(e,Bill)
		xix: Resolve ix and x: ~Eats(Bill,Apples)
		xx: Resolve vi and xix: Dies(Bill)
		xxi: Resolve xii and xx: ~Alive(Bill)

		There is a contradiction between viii and xxi, therefore Sue eats apples.

3. 
	(a) Is the instance satisfiable for 3 colors? 

		No.

	(b) Is the instance satisfiable for 4 colors? 

		Yes.

	(c) What do the answers of these two SAT instances tell you about the graph coloring problem of the above graph? Can you give a solution to the graph coloring problem based on the results of RSat?

		The graph coloring problem for graph1.txt requires 4 colors to be satisfiable. 

		By running RSat with the '-s' flag, we get the following solution:
		(-1 -2 -3 4 
		-5 -6 7 -8 
		-9 10 -11 -12
		-13 -14 15 -16 
		17 -18 -19 -20 
		-21 22 -23 -24 
		25 -26 -27 -28)

		The colorings are given as (Node,Color) below:
		(1,4)
		(2,3)
		(3,2)
		(4,3)
		(5,1)
		(6,2)
		(7,1)

	(d) What is the minimum number of colors required to properly color graph2.txt?
